###Hello gamers and developers 
- My name is Kenjin Ly-men and I love gaming and making games,
- Game development is really cool as I can do anything I want and make it to the way I want it to be 🤪
- I really want to see how this can go as I am excited to get to know the people and how they do things around there parts 👓.
- The one project that I am planning on doing is either a fps or a open world as I feel like I can be my most creative when making that, and I like the color blue the most ☠️.
